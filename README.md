## Introduction
Sequential network architectures, such as RNNs and CNNs, are powerful tools for processing and analyzing sequential data. In this project, we apply these architectures to a sentiment classification task, comparing their performance to identify the most efficient model. Sentiment classification is crucial in various applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a large-scale collection of text data labeled for sentiment analysis. The data is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the models' performance accurately.

## Results
The performance comparison between the CNN and RNN models is documented in the `results/performance_comparison.csv` file. The accuracy plots for both models are available in the `results/model_accuracy_plots.png` file.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of sequential network architectures for sentiment classification. By comparing the validation accuracy of CNN and RNN models, we identify the most efficient model for this task. The results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each architecture, guiding future improvements in sentiment analysis applications.
